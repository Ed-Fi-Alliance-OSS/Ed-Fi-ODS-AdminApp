    MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

    MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

    These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
    where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to
    the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if
    any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

    � updates,
    � supplements,
    � Internet-based services, and
    � support services

    for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

    BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
    USE THE SOFTWARE.

    IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.

    1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
      a. Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the
         software to design, develop and test your programs.
      b. Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that
         Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement.
         Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your
         information only.

    2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
      a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable Code.
         �Distributable Code� is code that you are permitted to distribute in
         programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
        i. Right to Use and Distribute.
            � You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
            � Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs
              to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
        ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute,
            you must
            � add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
            � require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
              protect it at least as much as this agreement;
            � display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
            � indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
              including attorneys� fees, related to the distribution or use of your

        iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not

              Code;

              suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
            � include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
              programs; or
            � modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
              that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
              Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
              modification or distribution, that
                � the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
                � others have the right to modify it.

    3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
       gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other

        � work around any technical limitations in the software;
        � reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only
          to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this
          limitation;
        � publish the software for others to copy;
        � rent, lease or lend the software;
        � transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
        � use the software for commercial software hosting services.

    4. BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it
       only to reinstall the software.

    5. DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or

      reference purposes.

    6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws
      and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international
      export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include
      restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional
      information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

    7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is �as is,� we may not provide
      support services for it.

    8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
      Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
      agreement for the software and support services.

    9. APPLICABLE LAW.

        a. United States. If you acquired the software in the United States,
           Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
           applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
           principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other
           claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
           competition laws, and in tort.

        b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other
           country, the laws of that country apply.

    10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
        other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
        respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement
        does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of
        your country do not permit it to do so.

    11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED �AS-IS.� YOU BEAR THE RISK
        OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
        CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES
        UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT
        PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
        OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER
        LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.

    12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
        MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU
        CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
        SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to

        � anything related to the software, services, content (including code)
          on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
        � claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
          condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
          permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
    you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential or other damages.

    Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the
    clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

    Remarque : Ce logiciel �tant distribu� au Qu�bec, Canada, certaines des clauses
    dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en fran�ais.

    EXON�RATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel vis� par une licence est offert � tel quel
    �. Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est � votre seule risque et p�ril. Microsoft

    additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce
    contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
    garanties implicites de qualit� marchande, d�ad�quation � un usage particulier
    et d�absence de contrefa�on sont exclues. LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INT�R�TS ET
    EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILIT� POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft
    et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement �
    hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez pr�tendre � aucune indemnisation pour les
    autres dommages, y compris les dommages sp�ciaux, indirects ou accessoires et
    pertes de b�n�fices. Cette limitation concerne :

    limite autoris�e par la loi en vigueur.

    Elle s�applique �galement, m�me si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait conna�tre
    l��ventualit� d�un tel dommage. Si votre pays n�autorise pas l�exclusion ou la
    limitation de responsabilit� pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
    quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l�exclusion
    ci-dessus ne s�appliquera pas � votre �gard.

    EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le pr�sent contrat d�crit certains droits juridiques. Vous
    pourriez avoir d�autres droits pr�vus par les lois de votre pays. Le pr�sent
    contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous conf�rent les lois de votre pays si
    celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
